# Random Text File Generator

This Python program generates a new text file with a random name and random content every time you run it.

## Features:

* Generates random filenames (10 characters long).
* Writes random text content (length can be adjusted).

## How to Use:

Save the script as a .py file (e.g., random_text_generator.py).
Run the script from your terminal using python random_text_generator.py.
Example:

## Running the script might print:

New file created: XQWRPLJKHG.txt

This indicates a new text file named XQWRPLJKHG.txt has been created with random content inside.

## Customization:

You can adjust the length of the random filename and text content by modifying the values in the script.
